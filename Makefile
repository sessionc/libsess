# Project makefile
#
# Makefiles are organised in a recursive structure
# Each directory has its own Makefile, and should
#  1. Set ROOT to relative path from project root
#  2. Include Common.mk (for compiler flags etc.)
#  3. Write directory-specific rules
#  4. Include Rules.mk (for global rules)
#
